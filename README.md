# DayZ-110-ZOMBIELAND-xml-mod-packs
A stand-alone collection of XMLs for DAYZ modding that will add LOTS OF ZOMBIES, Trucks &amp; 4x4's full of building materials &amp; other vehicles with survival loot, plus lots of other goodies. (CHERNARUS.)

You'll get small packs of Zombies spawning where police cars spawn, and large packs of zombies spawning in the countryside, where helipcopters spawn.

Chernarus only, just upload the new XMLS on top of the old ones on your server, and restart. Zombies should change pretty quickly, loot after a few days.
